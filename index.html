        Student Loan Crisis?
    </h1>
    <br>
        It is always widely claimed that student loan is increasing exponentially.
        With tuition increasing exponentially, did the student loans increase exponentially as well? How about starting salary?
    </br>    
    <br>    
        In this slide show of graphs, we will be showing the total cost of attending 
        a four-year university for four years (includes tuition, room and board), 
        against various metrics, including average student loan debt at graduation 
        and average starting salary in both current dollar (money at that time) and 2020 money.
